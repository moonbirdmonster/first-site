    <h1>...a handmade web...</h1>

    <p>as someone who has done all of their coding via web hosting services (cargo, weebly, wix, even shutterfly…) the idea of building something from the ground up is a bit daunting.

i love work where you can clearly see the artist’s hand. i spent a good amount of time my sophomore year of school creating web-art. projects i cannot hold in my hand and show to my classmates and let them hold it in their hands. it was a big adjustment as someone who is a big fan of physical, tangible, design. but web-art can be all of those things.
